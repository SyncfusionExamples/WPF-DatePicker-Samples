# How to display more looping items in the DateSelector and TimeSelector?

The count of LoopingSelectorItem (which are displayed in the Selected Looping Selector) is based on the Height of each looping item and available height of the SfDateSelector/SfTimeSelector of [WPF DatePicker](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/datepicker) (SfDatePicker). Default height of the Selector and Looping item is 500 and 80 respectively, so the default count of the LoopingSelectorItem is 5. Based on the required count of LoopingSelectorItem, we must change the height of the Selector.
